MBTA Alerts by Route
====================

### Introduction

Alerts by Route is a tiny Twitter bot designed to keep an account synced with the latest alert information for a specific line of the MBTA public transportation system. Based on the popular [MBTA Alerts](https://github.com/codeforboston/mbta-alerts) project created by [FredHQ](https://twitter.com/fredhq) and later resuscitated by [Code for Boston](http://www.codeforboston.org), Alerts by Route attempts to expand the public alert system that came before it to some of the less used lines of the system.

### Requirements

Alerts by Route was designed from the ground up to be simple to understand and lightweight to run. As such, only [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required. Upon installation, you will find that Alerts By Route includes the following libraries:

+ [simple-twitter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-twitter)
+ [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)

Looking to run Node.js on a budget? Try out [Node.php](https://github.com/niutech/node.php).
